# diffgame
Simple samegame clone for learning purposes


## Storyline ideas
* Doctor vs bacteria on a petri dish, as moves on the board runs out the bacterias get closer and closer to escaping, to eat humanity alive.
* Sysadmin/neckbeard vs AI (in space?). The AI tries to initiate a DDoS attack (that will subsequently result in really bad things), and it is your job as sysadmin to utilize all your tools to keep this from happening before it's too late.
* Tidy OCD vs messy roommate. You need to clean up the room before your roommate messes it up beyond what is possible to clean.
* Warehouse bot tries to manage warehouse and sales, larger blocks cleared (shipped) from warehouse generates more money for the company. Income can be used to invest in "weapons" that help clear warehouse, but will also be needed to pay for unforeseen expenses such as electrical bills etc.
* As an old SameGame world champion, you are now required to beat your old world record. Problem is your old world record is based on a lie. 20 odd years later you are revisited by journalists and sponsors requesting that you not only outperform yourself, but they will also try to make the challenges harder, seeing as you are the old world champion. You will need to play well and earn respect from journalists, in order to keep the lie alive, else you fail miserably and life as you know it is over.
