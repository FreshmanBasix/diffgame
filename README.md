Simple samegame clone for learning purposes

## Gameplay Mechanics
* Every stage fills the board with randomly coloured blocks. Mark adjacent blocks of same color to remove. The more blocks are chained, the more points are rewarded.
* When no more moves are possible, a stage is completed, all remaining blocks are "frozen in place" and cannot be acted upon in the next stage
* The players objective is to keep playing for as many stages as possible and achieving maximum possible point surplus. When the entire screen is filled with frozen blocks the game is over
* Random events, "acts of god", can occur during play with detrimental effects on results
Between stages NPC elements reward good results and punish bad results
* Between stages weapons, tools and buffs can be purchased for game currency, i.e produced points, to boost performance in upcoming stages. E.g 
  * double points
  * removal of frozen blocks
  * more beneficial starting blocks etc.
* Player has multiple options to adjust difficulty to make game harder. E.g;
  * pricehike or effect-nerf of buffs
  * changing time limit
  * higher intensity for acts of god
* Player can collect achievements by fullfilling specific conditions
