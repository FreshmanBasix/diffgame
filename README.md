# STORY IDEAS

## YU-GI-OH-ISH
**General Premise** Larger than life characters plays unproportionally silly games to the death

### THE OCD BOY AND THE HOARDER ROOMATE
Tidy OCD vs messy roommate. You need to clean up the room before your roommate messes it up beyond what is possible to clean.  

### THE LONELY WAREHOUSE BOT
Warehouse bot tries to manage warehouse and sales, larger blocks cleared (shipped) from warehouse generates more money for the company. Income can be used to invest in "weapons" that help clear warehouse, but will also be needed to pay for unforeseen expenses such as electrical bills etc.  

### WORLD RECORD CHEATING BASTARD
As an old SameGame world champion, you are now required to beat your old world record. Problem is your old world record is based on a lie. 20 odd years later you are revisited by journalists and sponsors requesting that you not only outperform yourself, but they will also try to make the challenges harder, seeing as you are the old world champion. You will need to play well and earn respect from journalists, in order to keep the lie alive, else you fail miserably and life as you know it is over.
